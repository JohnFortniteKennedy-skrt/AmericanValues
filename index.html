<h2>What is AmericanValues?</h2>
    <p>AmericanValues is a political quiz inspired by <a href="https://8values.github.io/">8values,</a> but tailored to the political climate of the United States. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2>What are the American values?</h2>
    <p>There are six independent axes - Culture, Solutions, Foreign, Social, Powers, and States - and each has two opposing values assigned to them. They are:</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#0288d1;">Liberalism</b> (Culture)<br/>
        Those with higher Liberalism scores believe the American way of life is morally wrong and needs to be fundamentally changed.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#d32f2f;">Conservatism</b> (Culture)<br/>
        Those with higher Conservatism scores believe the American way of life should be protected or restored.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#D15585;">Cooperation</b> (Solutions)<br/>
        Those with higher Cooperation scores believe all Americans should work together to solve their problems.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#fbc02d;">Individualism</b> (Solutions)<br/>
        Those with higher Individualism scores believe each American should solve their own problems independently.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#7CD1FF;">Globalism</b> (Foreign)<br/>
        Those with higher Globalism scores believe we should do more to help foreigners and work with other countries.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#f57c00;">America First</b> (Foreign)<br/>
        Those with higher America First scores believe we should put the interests of Americans above those of foreigners.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#00796b;">Freedom</b> (Social)<br/>
        Those with higher Freedom scores believe the government should leave Americans alone.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#303f9f;">Security</b> (Social)<br/>
        Those with higher Security scores believe the government should protect Americans from harm.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#7b1fa2;">Authority</b> (Power)<br/>
        Those with higher Authority scores believe the government's powers should be limitless.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#689f38;">Constitution</b> (Power)<br/>
        Those with higher Constitution scores believe the government's powers should be limited.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#a6a6a6ff;">Centralism</b> (States)<br/>
        Those with higher Centralism scores believe the federal government should decide most issues.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#30CC86;">State's Rights</b> (States)<br/>
        Those with higher State's Rights scores believe the states should be free to decide certain issues.</p>
<h2>What's the "Closest Match" mean at the bottom of the results?</h2>
    <p>In addition to matching you to the twelve American values, the quiz also attempts to match you to a political ideology. This is a work in progress and is much less accurate than the values and axes, so don't take it too seriously.</p>
<h2>I don't like my scores!</h2>
    <p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br/>
