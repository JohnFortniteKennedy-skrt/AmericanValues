# Announcement!
It's come to my attention that Reddit has found my shitty political test that I forgot even existed until my inbox was flooded with issues people opened on GitHub. (Thank yall!) I don't have an account there, so it took me a while to realize what was going on. (I made the decision to boycott Tencent years ago, and that includes Reddit, even though it's only partially owned by them.)

I'm planning on fixing the issues already opened, but might discontinue the test soon after. This was never meant to be accurate, merely a programming exercize to see how I could adapt other people's code. I did read the comments yall made, and the terrible results made me laugh; it really does suck! I'm sorry if the results disappointed you; don't be upset, laugh at how bad it was! :P

Now, to address a couple rumors the Liberals came up with: no, I'm not a Trump supporter; I voted for Rocky De La Fuente. And I'm not an "actual fascist" either; I believe in racial equality, support representative Democracy, and disavow anti-Semitism (I like Bernie!) â€” not to mention the fact that I'm literally transgender and the Nazis would have actually murdered me. I've had several arguments with real neo-Nazis, who call themselves such and politically align with Hitler, and we're nothing alike; they hate me. Don't feel too bad, the Trump supporters thought I was a Communist for a good while...

# What is AmericanValues?
AmericanValues is a political quiz inspired by 8values, but tailored to the political climate of the United States. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!

You can take the test [here.](https://theameliamay.github.io/AmericanValues/)
