# What is AmericanValues?
AmericanValues is a political quiz inspired by 8values, but tailored to the political climate of the United States. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!
